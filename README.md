# Abstract

Many countries across the globe are increasingly cracking down on civil
society groups through legal restrictions. While research on democratic
backsliding has tended to focus on rights and institutions in the
electoral arena, this new wave of laws—many of which appear mundane on
their face—represent a bureaucratic form of repressive that could be
indicative of more severe human rights abuses and backsliding. This is
especially the case for electoral democracies, which unlike autocracies
do not aggressively and openly attack civic space. In this paper, we
ask: do legal crackdowns on NGOs predict broader civil society
repression? We argue that this is the case because anti-NGO laws are
among the most subtle means of repression and attract the least least
domestic and international condemnation, as many audiences mistake this
repression as regulation and are not personally affected by it. These
laws also make it easier for states to prevent and deter future
large-scale popular mobilization. Using original data on civil society
restrictions over the last three decades, we test whether NGO crackdown
is a predictor of attacks on journalists, independent media, academic
freedom, and freedoms of expression and association. This project has
important implications: if crackdown on NGOs is indeed an early warning,
it can potentially prevent further deteriorations in space for civil
society.
